Po-Wei's terminal setup (forked from Wenzel). Contains nice default settings for

* vim
* tmux
* zsh
* git
* octave
* karabiner
* kitty
* xterm

The VIM configuration enables a few powerful features that I find very useful
for development and writing research papers:

* Code completion & validation for C++
* Code validation & PEP8 checks for Python
* Mathematical symbols in TeX using Unicode

Navigation through through tmux "pane"s and VIM windows works transparently
using the same set of key bindings.

On Linux, this is intended to be used with good old xterm, which blows modern
terminals (Gnome, KDE) out of the water especially when combined with tmux. On
MacOS, use kitty (https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). Everything (vim, tmux,
zsh) consistently uses the tomorrow night theme and powerline fonts. If you use
a different terminal, a number of carefully tweaked interactions won't work
anymore--you have been warned :).

The whole setup is optimized to have extremely low latency, both when starting
terminal/zsh/tmux/vim and during normal usage. For instance, the terminal
prompt shows the current repository branch (very quick to determine), but it
does not inspect whether there are changed files, which can easily add a few
hundred milliseconds of latency to each shell interaction when navigating
through complex projects. Over time, I have progressively replaced popular but
very heavy extensions (e.g. oh-my-zsh for ZSH, or YouCompleteMe for VIM) since
they added too much latency.

The keyboard layout in tmux and VIM is optimized around the home row
(HJKL-style navigation) and, e.g., also maps panel navigation and
home/end/pageup/pagedown into Alt+HJKL and Ctrl+HJKL. It soon feels very
natural, and it is no longer necessary to use the right portion of the
keyboard.

Miscellaneous features
----------------------

When running a SSH session, tmux will forward pane/window navigation key
bindings to the remote that is also presumed to run tmux. Prefix Ctrl-A to
execute them locally.
